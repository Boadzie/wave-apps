## App Description:

This Credit Card Default Risk demo presents predictions made by a machine learning model to a business user on whether or not someone is likely to pay off their credit card. The user can review each prediction and make the final say on if the applicant is approved or denied. This is purely a demonstration of including a human-in-the-loop with machine learning modeling. This is an [open source](https://github.com/h2oai/wave-apps/tree/main/credit-risk) app built on [public data](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset) and can be used as a starting point for H2O Wave developers.
